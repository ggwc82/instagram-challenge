User Stories
-------
```
As a user,
So that I can share my images,
I can create a new post with an image and caption

As a user,
So that I don't have posts with just text,
All posts must be created with an image

As a user,
So that I can see whats been posted,
When I visit the website I can see all the posts

As a user,
So that I can view a single post,
I can click on it and view that single post
```
